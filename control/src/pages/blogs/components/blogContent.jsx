          Connecting with coworkers over common goals and shared interests has
          always been one of the best
          <br /> parts about office life. But in the{" "}
          <span>hybrid-remote workplace</span>, team lunches, happy hours,
          offsite events,
          <br /> and other opportunities to get to know colleagues are few and
          far between—if not replaced altogether
          <br /> by video conferences.
          <br />
          <br />
          According to <span>Zuri Chat</span> Future Forum study of 10,000
          knowledge workers, robust digital infrastructures
          <br /> will remain critical to boosting employees’ sense of belonging
          in a post-pandemic world. With Zuri Chat,
          <br /> coworkers can get to know each other beyond the daily grind,
          engage in team rituals, recognize each <br />
          other’s hard work, and celebrate each person’s unique point of view
          and contributions.
          <br />
          <br />
          Whether your organization has returned to the brick-and-mortar office,
          is fully remote, or is a hybrid of
          <br /> both, here are a few ways you can use Slack to strengthen team
          connection.
          <br />
          <br />
          When teams are juggling multiple projects and competing priorities, it
          can feel like all that hard work
          <br /> isn’t being seen or noticed by peers and team leaders. And when
          colleagues are working remotely, it’s <br />
          especially common to feel overlooked—out of sight, out of mind.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>Zuri Chat</span> makes it easy to nurture a culture of peer
          recognition through acknowledging wins, birthdays,
          <br /> and work anniversaries in public channels. It takes only a
          couple of quick steps to make these small but
          <br /> meaningful gestures of appreciation part of your team’s
          culture.
